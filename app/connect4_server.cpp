/*

A server-side application for a connect4 game.
This application uses the net_server class to handle its networking.

Whenever a client connects, the server will search all other clients to see
if there is another client not currently in a game. If such a client exists,
a game will be started.

The game state is only maintained on the server-side, so the server needs
to send the entire state of the game board to both clients after each turn.

After each turn is processed, the server will check to see if the game is finished
(either due to a player winning, or the game ending in a draw) and the clients
will be notified accordingly.

If a client disconnects mid-game, their opponent will be put back into the queue
of players waiting for an opponent.
